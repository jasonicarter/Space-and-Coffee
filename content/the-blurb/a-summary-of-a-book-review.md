A little background on "The Blurb" posts since this is the very first one.

I wanted an area were I can give you (and lets be honest here, give me) a place to quickly give a shout out to sci-fi books, or even TV shows based on books, that I may not have written a review for. And it may not even be a positive blurb - although I'm pretty sure by definition it's no longer a "blurb". But who cares!

And don't worry, it won't be anything long an exhausting just a quick blurb.
