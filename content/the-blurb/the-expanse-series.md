Let us start off "The Blurb" with this decade's best science fiction show on TV, The Expanse, second for the best this century only to [Battlestar Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)).

I started reading the The Expance (Book) series, by James S.A. Corey, about 6 months after the first book, [Leviathan Wakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) , was released. It's an amazing space opera set in the "realistic, forseeable future" where social, racial and political biases still exist (as if that will ever change). The world building, character arcs and stories are (almost) always great and not just for the main characters either, and the science is real (or at least as real as it can be - it's still sci-fi after all).

And although the book series has its low moments, those are few and far between. And with 9 books to the series (8 currently published), there's a lot of greatness to enjoy. The Expanse (Book) series has also been picked up as a TV series, originally by the SyFy channel and now it currently runs on Amazon (another Blurb on that to come).

**Recommendation:** High
