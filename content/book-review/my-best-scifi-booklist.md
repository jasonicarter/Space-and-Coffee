## Books I've Read but not Reviewed

Yes, this is a book review site but sometimes I completely forget to review books. My bad.
I do however, have some favourite, and not so favourite, books I'd like to share with you.
As of 2019 (late-ish) these are the books I've read (up to and including in 2019) that made it to my *all-time greatest* list.

## Re-Read and Review

I don't typically re-read books unless it's been years and I have nothing on new on the list - it's kindof like Netflix, with so many new things to watch I don't get a chance to watch everything I want in a timely manner, let alone re-watch great TV.

But that being said, I'll try to pick up one or two and given the read mainly so I can jot down my thoughts the second time around for a good review.
