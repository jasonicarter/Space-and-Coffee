## Review

It all stared with the big bang. Well, the great thing about A Brief History of Time, is that it doesn't just throw you into the deep in of the cosmos. Stephen Hawking, thankfully and wonderfully let us put each toe into the wrapping of space-time even before we precieved of such a notion, taking us back to the beginning - of our concept of the universe - the early 1300s `#TODO [check date]`

From the first moments and throughout the rest of the book, mind blowing expansion ensues and not the heavy handed physics kind but a gentle handed guidence (sometimes push) through history.

Let me first say, I have a background in engineering and a preference to hard sci-fi novels so it was a bit of surprise when, even in the early chapters, I had to re-read sentences and sections once or twice before fully understanding the concept and its consequence to previously understood and validated theories.

## My Recommendation

It would be too easy to say, "This is a modern day classic by a 20th century scientific genuis, who has been capable of effectively distilling high concept theories and ideas, to the everyday laymen person". But I would be wrong. You see, I wouldn't consider myself the "everyday laymen person" given my Software Engineering background and particular interest in sci-fi and "real" space expoloration. However, as I read through the book I'm constantly re-reading sentences and diagrams, gripping onto concepts for dare life. But I endure and feel both smarter and dumber coming out the other side.

Yes, I highly recommend giving this book a read. And not just for certain types of people
knowledge of the universe is about learning (and caring) more about just ourselves
It's not the easiest book to swallow but I've read some stupid technical, so called, beginners books in my life and this is the most insightful, enlightening, fustrating and satisfying read I've had.
