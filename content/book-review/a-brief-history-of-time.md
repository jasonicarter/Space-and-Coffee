<!-- Your Praise and Critique -->
It all stared with the big bang. Well, the great thing about A Brief History of Time, is that it doesn't just throw you into the deep in of the cosmos. Stephen Hawking, thankfully and wonderfully let us put each toe into the wrapping of space-time even before we precieved of such a notion, taking us back to the beginning - of our concept of the universe - the early 1300s `#TODO [check date]`

From the first moments and throughout the rest of the book, mind blowing expansion ensues and not the heavy handed physics kind but a gentle handed guidence (sometimes push) through history.

Let me first say, I have a background in engineering and a preference to hard sci-fi novels so it was a bit of surprise when, even in the early chapters, I had to re-read sentences and sections once or twice before fully understanding the concept and its consequence to previously understood and validated theories.
